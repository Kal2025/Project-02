The data set I plotted above represents the change in gas prices from 1990 all the way to 2008. The graph compares the flunctuations and prices of the five following countries: US, UK, South Korea, Germany, and Japan. As shown in the graph, we see an overall upward trend in prices of gas for all countries over the 20 year period.
