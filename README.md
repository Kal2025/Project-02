The data set I plotted above represents the change in gas prices from 1990 all the way to 2008. The graph compares the flunctuations and prices of the five following countries: US, UK, South Korea, Germany, and Japan. As shown in the graph, we see an overall upward trend in prices of gas for all countries over the 20 year period.

The graph above represents the change in the value of the US GDP (Gross Domestic Product) from 1960 all the way to 2021. As shown in the graph above, there is an overall upward trend as the value of the GDP (dollars in trillions) skyrockets upwards throughout the years. During 1960, the approximate value of the US GDP was 0.1 USD, in recent years (2021), the value has increased all the way to approximatetly 2.4 USD.
